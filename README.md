 Touchdesigner TOX for Picking Color and Grabbing Screen Shots
 
 This TOX uses a custom Mouse In CHOP to work across desktops. Touchdesigner must be the active application for this to work.
 
 The only difference between the color picking mode and the screen grabbing mode is if you move the mouse while holding down the *Control* key.
 
 ## Usage:
 
 
 ### Picking Color:
 
 1. Activate the Tox by clicking on the *On/Off* Toggle, under *Settings*
 2. Right click on the Tox, and select *View*
 3. Mouse over the color you want to choose
 4. Press and Release the *Control* key. **DO NOT MOVE THE MOUSE** during this. 
 
 The colors you picked will be outputted to output 2 and 3. Output 2 gives you the colors in a DAT. Output 3 gives you the color(s) as a single image laid out in a grid.
 
 
 
 ### Grabbing a Screen Shot
 
 1. Activate the Tox by clicking on the *On/Off* Toggle, under *Settings*
 2. Right click on the Tox, and select *View*
 3. Move your mouse to one of the corners of the area you want to capture.
 4. Press and **HOLD** the *Control* key. 
 5. Move your mouse to the opposite corner of the area you want to capture.
 6. Let go of the *Control* key.
 
 You can select the images you have captured with the *Screen Shot Output Index* slider under the *Settings* page.
